\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, I have presented an approximation algorithm for the \Partition problem. The algorithm is based on the work of Deng et al. \cite{deng}. Although the algorithm doesn't seem to have been designed with practical implementation in mind it is significantly faster than the naive algorithm even for small input sizes.

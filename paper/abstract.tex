    \Partition is an NP-complete \cite{eshard} problem that asks whether a given set of integers can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum. I implement an approximation algorithm described in "Approximating Knapsack and Partition via Dense Subset Sums"\cite{deng}. The algorithm runs in $\tildeO(n + \sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)$ where $n$ is the size of the input set and $\varepsilon$ is the desired approximation factor.
